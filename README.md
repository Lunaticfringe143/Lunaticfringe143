# Gandhi Bashyam

AI Platform & Infrastructure Engineering (in transition)  
Technical Lead — DevOps & Test Automation | 11+ years experience

---

## What I Do
I design and debug systems — especially where software meets infrastructure.

My current focus:
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- LLM guardrails & evaluation
- Distributed object storage (Ceph RGW internals)
- Latency optimization & caching
- Observability for AI systems

## Active Engineering Work
🧠 Enterprise RAG Knowledge Assistant (building)  
🏦 Banking Guardrailed Chatbot (building)  
🗄 Ceph Internals & RGW Debugging Lab (active OSS investigation)

---

## Core Skills
Languages: Python, Bash  
Backend: FastAPI, REST APIs  
Infra: Docker, Linux, CI/CD, Jenkins  
Storage: Ceph, Object Storage Concepts  
Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector Databases  
Concepts: System Design, Performance Optimization, Caching, Async Pipelines

## What I'm Working Towards
AI/ML Infrastructure Engineer / GenAI Platform Engineer roles (2026)

I enjoy understanding how systems fail, not just how they work.

---

## Current Learning Track
- Building production-style GenAI applications (not notebooks)
- RAG retrieval optimization (latency benchmarking)
- Guardrails and safety in LLM systems
- Distributed storage debugging (Ceph)

---

### Selected Work
- Ceph OSS debugging & analysis
- Resume parsing pipeline & API
- Automation frameworks & infra tooling
